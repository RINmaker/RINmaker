# RING Binaries

This zip containts the pre-compiled binary distribution of RING.

It includes:

- the _RING_ executable pre-compiled for a given OS:
	- Windows, Linux and OSX are supported at the moment
	- each version is distributed in a different zip file

- the _reduce_ executable for Linux/Unix/WSL2:
	- it processes pdb files by adding missing hydrogen atoms; RING needs those, so run it on the pdb files you are willing to pass to RING
	- runs on Linux/Unix and WSL2 under Windows
	- this is an external unmaintained program 

- *Windows only* the _VC\_redist.x64.exe_ Visual C++ runtime redistributable:
	- install it if you already haven't
